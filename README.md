# introduction to python 

What is Python?
Python is a programming language that is widely used in web applications, software development, data science, and machine learning (ML). Developers use Python because it is efficient and easy to learn and can run on many different platforms. Python software is free to download, integrates well with all types of systems, and increases development speed.

What are the benefits of Python?
Benefits of Python include:

Developers can easily read and understand a Python program because it has basic, English-like syntax. 
Python makes developers more productive because they can write a Python program using fewer lines of code compared to many other languages.
Python has a large standard library that contains reusable codes for almost any task. As a result, developers do not have to write code from scratch.

How is Python used?
The Python language has several use cases in application development, including the following examples:

Server-side web development
Automation with Python scripts
A scripting language is a programming language that automates tasks that humans normally perform. Programmers widely use Python scripts to automate many day-to-day tasks such as the following:

Renaming a large number of files at once
Converting a file to another file type
Removing duplicate words in a text file
Performing basic mathematical operations
Sending email messages
Downloading content
Performing basic log analysis
Finding errors in multiple files
Data science and machine learning
Data science is extracting valuable knowledge from data, and machine learning (ML) teaches computers to automatically learn from the data and make accurate predictions. Data scientists use Python for data science tasks such as the following:

Fixing and removing incorrect data, which is known as data cleaning 
Extracting and selecting various features of data
Data labeling, which is adding meaningful names for the data
Finding different statistics from data
Visualizing data by using charts and graphs such as line charts, bar graphs, histograms, and pie charts
 
Data scientists use Python ML libraries to train ML models and build classifiers that accurately classify data. People in different fields use Python-based classifiers to do classification tasks such as image, text, and network traffic classification; speech recognition; and facial recognition. Data scientists also use Python for deep learning, an advanced ML technique.
Software development
Software developers often use Python for different development tasks and software applications such as the following:

Keeping track of bugs in the software code
Automatically building the software
Handling software project management
Developing software prototypes
Developing desktop applications using Graphical User Interface (GUI) libraries
Developing simple text-based games to more complex video games
Software test automation
Software testing is the process of checking whether the actual results from the software match the expected results to ensure that the software is error-free. 

Developers use Python unit test frameworks, such as Unittest, Robot, and PyUnit, to test the functions they write. 
Software testers use Python to write test cases for various test scenarios. For example, they use it to test the user interface of a web application, multiple software components, and new features. 
Developers can use several tools to automatically run test scripts. These tools are known as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools. Software testers and developers use CI/CD tools such as Travis CI and Jenkins to automate tests. The CI/CD tool automatically runs the Python test scripts and reports the test results whenever developers introduce new code changes.
